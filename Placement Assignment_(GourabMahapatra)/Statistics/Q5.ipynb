    "To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events as follows:\n",

    "    A: The taxi belongs to Company A.\n",
    "    B: The taxi is late.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We are given the following probabilities:\n",
    "    P(A) = 0.8 (Company A has 80% of the taxis)\n",
    "    P(B|A) = 0.05 (Company A's taxis have a 95% success rate, so the probability of being late is 1 - 0.95 = 0.05)\n",

    "\n",
    "    We need to calculate P(A|B), which is the probability that the taxi belongs to Company A given that it is late.\n",
    "\n",
    "    According to Bayes' theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "    P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\n",

    "    To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "    P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Since there are only two taxi companies, P(not A) = 1 - P(A).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Let's calculate the probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "    P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)\n",
    "        = 0.05 * 0.8 + 0.10 * 0.2\n",
    "        = 0.04 + 0.02\n",
    "        = 0.06\n",
    "\n",
    "    Now we can calculate P(A|B):\n",

    "        = 2/3\n",

    "\n",
    "    Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected taxi is from Company A given that it is late is approximately 0.6667 or 66.67%."
