    "**Ans 7:** To solve the problem, let's analyze the given regression equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Equation 1: 2X + 3Y - 8 = 0\n",
    "    Equation 2: 2Y + X - 5 = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "We can rewrite Equation 1 as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    3Y = 8 - 2X\n",
    "    Y = (8 - 2X) / 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we substitute the value of Y from Equation 1 into Equation 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "    2[(8 - 2X) / 3] + X - 5 = 0\n",
    "    (16 - 4X) / 3 + X - 5 = 0\n",
    "    16 - 4X + 3X - 15 = 0\n",
    "    -X + 1 = 0\n",
    "    X = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the value of X, we can substitute it back into Equation 1 to find Y:\n",
    "\n",
    "    2(1) + 3Y - 8 = 0\n",
    "    2 + 3Y - 8 = 0\n",
    "    3Y - 6 = 0\n",
    "    3Y = 6\n",
    "    Y = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Variance of Y:\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance of X is given as 4. To find the variance of Y, we need to calculate the sum of squares of the differences between\n",
    "each Y value and the mean of Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean of Y can be found using the given regression equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Y = (8 - 2X) / 3\n",
    "    Y = (8 - 2(1)) / 3\n",
    "    Y = 6/3\n",
    "    Y = 2\n",

    "Now, calculate the variance of Y:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance of Y = Œ£(Y - Y_mean)^2 / n\n",

    "Since we only have one data point for Y (Y = 2), the variance is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Coefficient of determination between X and Y:\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficient of determination (R^2) measures the proportion of the total variation in the dependent variable (Y) that can be explained by the independent variable (X).\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the coefficient of determination, we need the total sum of squares (SST), regression sum of squares (SSR), and residual sum of squares (SSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "    SST = Œ£(Y - Y_mean)^2\n",
    "    SSR = Œ£(Y_predicted - Y_mean)^2\n",
    "    SSE = Œ£(Y - Y_predicted)^2\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficient of determination is given by:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    R^2 = SSR / SST\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we only have one data point for Y, all the sums will be zero. Therefore, the coefficient of determination is also zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Standard error of estimate of X on Y and Y on X:\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard error of estimate (SEE) measures the average deviation of the observed Y values from the predicted Y values (from the regression line).\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the standard error of estimate of X on Y, we use the regression equation for X on Y:\n",
    "\n",
    "    2X + 3Y - 8 = 0\n",
    "    2X + 3(2) - 8 = 0\n",
    "    2X + 6 - 8 = 0\n",
    "    2X - 2 = 0\n",
    "    2X = 2\n",
    "    X = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard error of estimate of X on Y is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SEE(X|Y) = sqrt(SSE_X|Y / (n - 2))\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we only have one data point, n = 1. Therefore, the standard error of estimate of X on Y is undefined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, to calculate the standard error of estimate of Y on X, we use the regression equation for Y on X:\n",
    "\n",
    "    2Y + X - 5 = 0\n",
    "    2Y + 1 - 5 = 0\n",
    "    2Y - 4 = 0\n",
    "    2Y = 4\n",
    "    Y = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard error of estimate of Y on X is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SEE(Y|X) = sqrt(SSE_Y|X / (n - 2))\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we only have one data point, n = 1. Therefore, the standard error of estimate of Y on X is undefined.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Variance of Y = 0\n",
    "    b. Coefficient of determination (R^2) = 0\n",
    "    c. Standard error of estimate:\n",
    "       - SEE(X|Y) = undefined\n",
